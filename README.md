- Filebeat ships those logs to Logstash.
- Logstash parses and pushes them to Elasticsearch.
- Kibana displays real-time dashboards.

 Zero-cost deployment using local Docker containers.

## Log Volume Over Time Chart
This chart is based on a Vertical Bar Graph, on the X-axis we have the time @timestamp, and on the Y-axis we have Count of Records 
Usage:
With this chart we can keep track of the number of Records aka the logs we have received each day or customize the time @timestamp by the preference of hour, minutes, days, or according to our needs.
